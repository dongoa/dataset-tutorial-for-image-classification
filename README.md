# Organizing your data

To put together a dataset for training an image classifier, you need to organize your data like so:

```
- /folder-containing-your-images
  - /training
    - /class-one
    - /class-two
  - /validation
    - /class-one
    - /class-two
```

## Example
Let's say you want to recognize cats vs. dogs. Your folder structure would look like:

```
- /folder-containing-your-images
  - /training
    - /cats
    - /dogs
  - /validation
    - /cats
    - /dogs
```
